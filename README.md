# Codestrates

[Codestrates](codestrates.org) is a literate computing approach to developing interactive software inspired by interactive notebooks such as [Jupyter notebook](http://jupyter.org). However, in Codestrates, real-time collaboration is built in, it is possible to create stand-alone applications with persistent state, and to reprogram the functionality of the environment it self. To learn more you can videos and a research article on [codestrates.org](codestrates.org).

## Use
To use Codestrates you need access to a [Webstrates](webstrates.net) server. Refer to the [Webstrates documentation](webstrates.github.io) for instructions on how to set one up.
To create a new codestrate on a Webstrates server go to:  
`yourserver.com/new?prototypeUrl=https://github.com/cklokmose/Codestrates/archive/master.zip`.

[You can also try out Codestrates on the demo.webstrates.net server](yourserver.com/new?prototypeUrl=https://github.com/cklokmose/Codestrates/archive/master.zip).
