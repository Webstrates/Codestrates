# Codestrates

[Codestrates](http://codestrates.org) is a literate computing approach to developing interactive software inspired by interactive notebooks such as [Jupyter notebook](http://jupyter.org). However, in Codestrates, real-time collaboration is built in, it is possible to create stand-alone applications with persistent state, and to reprogram the functionality of the environment it self. 

Codestrates builds on [Webstrates](http://webstrates.net). A web-page served from a Webstrates server is called a _webstrate_, and is a web-page where changes to the document object model (DOM) are persisted to the server and synchronized with other clients of the same page.
A codestrate is a webstrate that contains everything needed for developing new content, or reprogramming the codestrate it self. So, Codestrates provides a literate computing based development environment for Webstrates.
On [codestrates.org](http://codestrates.org) you can learn more about the Codestrates research project. Visit [webstrates.net](http://webstrates.net) to learn more about Webstrates.

## Use
To use Codestrates you need access to a [Webstrates](http://webstrates.net) server. Refer to the [Webstrates documentation](http://webstrates.github.io) for instructions on how to set one up.
To create a new codestrate on a Webstrates server go to:  
`yourserver.com/new?prototypeUrl=https://github.com/Webstrates/Codestrates/archive/master.zip`.

You can also [click here to create a codestrates on the demo.webstrates.net server](https://demo.webstrates.net/new?prototypeUrl=https://github.com/Webstrates/Codestrates/archive/master.zip).

## Disclaimer

Codestrates is a research prototype in active development. Many features are still experimental and yet to be properly documented.
